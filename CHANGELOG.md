     - **Add WAV Audio media file support - by [sassman], [pull/6]**
 
       `stegano` has now support for input and output wav audio files (*.wav). This means that hiding secret messages and files are now **not** only possible for png image media files but also wav audio files in the same way. For example like this: 
 
       ```sh
       ‚ùØ stegano hide \
         -i resources/plain/carrier-audio.wav \
         -d resources/secrets/Blah.txt \
            resources/secrets/Blah-2.txt \
         -o secret.wav
       ```
